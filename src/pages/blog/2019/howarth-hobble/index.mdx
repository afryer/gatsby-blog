## A wet day for a run

![my image](./hobble.jpg)

The first race of my runfurther series goal for the year and the closer it got the worse the weather became. The final forecast being windy and absolutley chucking it down with rain.

On arriving I could see that the forcast was spot on and it was a day to start in waterproofs. Setting off the wind was immidiatly playing its part and I tried to tuck in between runners and occasionally pushing onto the tail end of another. I found this qiute fun and a bit like bike racing but was keen not to push to hard early on.

I started to feel quite good coming up to widdup but know the next section was going to be tough directly into the wind on an exposed moor. The wind was wipping water over the reservoir wall but at least there was a brief lull in the rain.
