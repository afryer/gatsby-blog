A new year that has started very much like the start of the last one. Restricted liberties and a strange situation in life.

The ever changing situation during the pandemic has made me realise I am someone who needs routine, structure and goals to personally progress. This has focused my needs this year and to think about my goals differently this year.

Instead of planning goals and targets, I have been thinking more about how to change that mindset that goals are a target and move to a more sustainable thought of balance and change.

This does not change my need for routine and structure, in fact it leans more on that to ensure I achieve balance.

Last year I had a lot of targets/goals. Ramsey round was front and centre but the pandemic made that impossible. Without that goal mixed with lockdown my fitness plummetted. When restrictions were lifted I was playing catch up.

Pandemic brought home schooling, working from home. Work brough new role, new teams, working from home. The constant change meant routine was always challenged

## Balance - what does that mean

I see I need to balance work, family, personal. I need to decide what I need to achieve from each of these 3 areas and then be able to work towards them.

### work

New role has meant new and extended responsibilities. A real challenge, but something that I really enjoy. Its something I am very keen to do well. I have recently been promoted to tech lead of a cross functional web development team for a major financial institution. The team is new and the organisation is going through a lot of positive change at the moment. I see this as an opportunity that I need to work with.

Having spent a couple of months getting up to speed, my goal over the next year is to find my path. This will invole learning AWS properly, understand how to measure teams and to really 'get' devops. I am sure there will be blog posts on this as I progress in this journey.

## family

I class myself as very lucky here. An amazing wife and two boisterous loving boys to make my home life a joy. 2021 is a massive year for the Fryer family. We are moving house very soon in to what we hope to be our forever home. It needs some serious work doing to it so this is a major focus.

## personal

Yes I class personal different from familiy! To be the best you can be for others you need to be happy in yourself.

Last year I regretted not staying fit as it seemed a lot of people did. This meant when others were having big adventures in the late Summer I scaled mine back. This year will be different.

I have started at the end of last year with Love to run coaching and am starting to make progress. Consistency is key, albeit I imagine I am far from an ideal person, occasional gaps where I go awol as life interfers.

Workwise, I have recently taken on a new role with a lot more responsibilities. Great challenge that I am enjoying but mentally taking up a lot of space in a head already pretty stretched with WFH, house move, a family and a pandemic already taking limited space.
