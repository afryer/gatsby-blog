After tinkering with Gatsby but not quite diving in deep, the [Gatsby 100 days of code challenge](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/, 'Gatsby challenge') came up. It seemed a good time to get stuck in.

I had a site working but not published. Just not following the 'release early, release often' idea.

I have a few things I would like to get out of the challenge. So I have a bit of a roadmap

- Launch a blog
- pagination
- categories
- plugin - strava?
- theme
